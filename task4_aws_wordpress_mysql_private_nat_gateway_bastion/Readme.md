In this article we are going to host a wordpress application on AWS in a secure manner. 
A wordpress application requires us to run wordpress and MySQL. We are going to create a VPC and two subnets in it. Out of which one subnet can access the internet through an internet gateway and another subnet is a private subnet which accesses the internet through a NAT gateway and a bastion host. We are going to be running three EC2 instances one running wordpress, another one running MySQL and one which acts as an bastion host. The EC2 instance running wordpress is publically available through our public subnet. However, our MySQL instance has access only to our private subnet. Our wordpress instance can access our MySQL instance through our private subnet. The bastion host has access to our public subnet and NAT gateway. Our MySQL instance can be remotely accessed through our bastion host. This enhances the security of our application. The use of bastion host enables us to access our MySQL instance but it is going to be extremely difficult to exploit due to presence of our bastion host. I am going t assume you have already installed AWS CLI and created a profile. '''
